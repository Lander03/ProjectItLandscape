## Welcome to My IT Landscape Project

Hello! My name is **Lander Cuypers**, I'm 19 years old and currently studying **Programming Graduate** at **UCLL (University College Leuven-Limburg)**. This documentation project was created for the **IT Landscape** course, where I document and demonstrate various modern technologies and development practices that I saw at school.
