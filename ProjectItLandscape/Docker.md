## 1 What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that makes it easy to develop your applications in containers. These containers ensure that your projects run in an isolated environment. It doesn't matter which operating system you use because everything is included in the container.

Docker is becoming increasingly popular. Since 2015, the use of Docker has increased by 25% among companies. Currently, it is widely used.

## 1.2 The three main components of Docker

Within Docker, there are three very important essential components:

- **Dockerfile** üìù  
  A Dockerfile can be compared to the DNA of an application. It contains the instructions/code for creating an image.

- **Image** üì∑  
  An image is a ready-to-use software package with all dependencies. Multiple containers can be started from an image.

- **Container** üì¶  
  A container is a running instance of an image. Containers are lightweight and isolated.

## 2.1 Installing Docker

There are several ways to install Docker. In this documentation, I will explain step by step how to install Docker. It is important to note that I will only explain how to do this on a Windows system.  
For Windows, we use **Docker Desktop**.

Docker Desktop can be installed in two ways:

1. Via the Installer
2. Via the Console

Both methods are explained below.

---

## 2.1.1 Download Docker Desktop

Before we can install Docker, we need to download Docker Desktop. This file is required for both installation methods.

You can download Docker Desktop from the official website:  
üëâ [Docker Desktop download](https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial/)

Click the link and then click **Download Docker Desktop**.

---

## 2.2 Installation via the Installer

Make sure you have downloaded the Docker Desktop installer before you begin.

### Steps:

1. Double-click the downloaded **Docker Desktop Installer** file to start the installation. üñ±Ô∏è
2. A window will appear where you can choose to add a desktop shortcut. üìã
3. Click **OK** and wait for Docker to extract all files. ‚è≥
4. Once the installation is complete and you see the message **Installation Succeeded**, click **Close**. ‚úÖ
5. Open Docker Desktop, and voil√†, Docker is installed! üéâ

<p align="center">
  <img src="fotos/docker/fotoDockerDesktop.png" width="500" style="border-radius: 15px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);"/>
</p>

---

## 2.3 Installation via the Console

For this method, you also need to download the Docker Desktop installer first.

### Steps:

1. Open the **Command Prompt** (cmd) or **PowerShell**.
2. Navigate to the folder where the Docker Desktop Installer is stored using the command:

   ```sh
   cd Downloads
   ```

3. Execute this command to install Docker Desktop:  
   Via the Terminal:
   ```sh
   "Docker Desktop Installer.exe" install
   ```
   Via PowerShell:
   ```sh
   Start-Process 'Docker Desktop Installer.exe' -Wait install
   ```
   Via the Windows Command Prompt:
   ```sh
   start /w "" "Docker Desktop Installer.exe" install
   ```
4. After a successful installation, you will see a message in the console indicating the process is complete.

<p align="center">
  <img src="fotos/docker/dockerConsole.png" width="500" style="border-radius: 15px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);"/>
</p>

5. Open **Docker Desktop**.
6. Choose whether you want a desktop shortcut and click **Next**.
7. Click **Close** and restart Docker.

# 3 Docker Commands

Docker commands can be divided into 4 categories:

1. Images
2. Docker Hub
3. General Commands
4. Containers

I will go over these 4 commands for you. I say 4 because we have already covered the installation above. If you're unsure how to do it, feel free to review it again.

## 3.1 Images

---

1. This first command is to create a Docker image from a DockerFile.
   ```sh
   docker build -t my-image .

- **-t** is a tag you give to the image. This can be a name, a name with a version, or a name with a version and a tag.
- **.** is the directory where the DockerFile is located.

---

2. This command creates a Docker image from a DockerFile without using the cache.
   ```sh
   docker build -t <image_name> . ‚Äìno-cache
   ```

- **<image_name>** This is the name of the image you want to create.
- **.** is the directory where the DockerFile is located.
- **‚Äìno-cache** is an option that disables the cache. This can be useful if you want to create the image from a modified DockerFile.

---

3. This command is used to display a list of all Docker images.
   ```sh
   docker images
   ```

# 4 Dockerfile

## 4.1 What is a Dockerfile?

As we all know by now, we need a Dockerfile to build a Docker container, or more accurately, an image. But what exactly is a Dockerfile?  
Let me explain it clearly. A Dockerfile is essentially a text document containing instructions for building Docker images. It's like a recipe for creating a Docker image. Docker will automatically read this file and execute the instructions to build a Docker image. So, it's like a script, but for Docker.

We were tasked with creating our own Dockerfile. I created a simple Dockerfile with a Python file. What this does is display "Hello World" on the website.

<p align="center">
  <img src="fotos/dockerfile.png" width="500" style="border-radius: 15px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);"/>
</p>

## 4.2 The Dockerfile

I will now explain the Dockerfile step by step.

---

The first line of code is:

```sh
FROM python:3.9-slim
```

This means we are using the official Python image as the base of the image.

---

The second line of code is:

```sh
WORKDIR /app
```

This sets the working directory.

---

Next, we have:

```sh
COPY requirements.txt .
```

This copies the requirements from the requirements.txt file to the container.

---

After that, we have:

```sh
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

This ensures that the requirements we just copied are downloaded.

---

The penultimate line is:

```sh
COPY . .
```

This copies the rest of the application to the container. So, it copies all other files we have coded in.

---

The very last line of code is:

```sh
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

This sets the command to be executed when the container starts. In this case, it's app.py.

# 5 Docker Compose

## 5.1 What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is essentially a tool that helps you manage and configure multiple Docker containers. Docker Compose consists of a YAML file where the configuration of the containers is defined.  
You can do a lot with Docker Compose; here are a few examples:

- You can define and configure multiple containers.
- You can start and stop containers.
- What's also very handy is that you can enable communication between containers.

## 5.2 Docker Compose file with explanation

I created an example of a Docker Compose file. I will first provide the entire file and then explain it.

```sh
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build:
      context: ./web
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - MONGO_URI=mongodb://db:27017/mydatabase

  db:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo_data:/data/db

volumes:
  mongo_data:
```

The first line is `version: '3.8'`. This tells Docker Compose which version of Docker Compose we are using.

We then have the line `services:`, where the different services are defined.

The first service we have is `web`. There are a few important things:  
First, the `ports`, which is the port we use to host our website.  
Then we have `depends_on`, which ensures that the database section is started before the website is started.

The second service we have is the `mongo database`. This is also clearly defined with a port.
